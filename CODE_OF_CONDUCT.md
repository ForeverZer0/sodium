# The "Anti Code of Conduct" Code of Conduct

## Our Standards

We do not believe in "codes of conduct" or dictating how others should conduct
themselves, least of all in relation to an online code repository.

The only "rule" is that anyone who suggests amendments to this code of conduct,
or make known their disapproval of it, may have their privilege to interact with
the project revoked.

For any further issues about this or complaints regarding the online conduct of
others, please consult with your therapist.
